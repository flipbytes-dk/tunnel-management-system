  - BIM formats
  - AutoCAD
  - Navisworks drawings (supplied by the Company)

- **360° camera view** in 3D visualization mode apart from Synthetic data from drawings

- **Walkthroughs** similar to Street View

- **Integration to other TMS Software modules** as per interface protocol/API shared by the Company
  - Note: APIs are indicative/tentative and subject to change based on new requirements during MMI/UI design and development phase

- **Development of interactive user interfaces** for operators in the control room with **2 supported displays:**

  | Display | Purpose |
  |---------|---------|
